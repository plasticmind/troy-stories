*What's your greatest piece of advice about life?*

You're asking the wrong person... I've got a pretty negative view of life. As someone with a learning disability, I can say that life isn't fair.  Doesn't the Bible say something about children suffering for the sins of their fathers? I've definitely experienced that.  But you've gotta give it your best, no matter what that best looks like.
