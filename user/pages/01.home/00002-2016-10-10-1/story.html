<p><em>What&#8217;s your greatest piece of advice about life?</em></p>

<p>You&#8217;re asking the wrong person&#8230; I&#8217;ve got a pretty negative view of life. As someone with a learning disability, I can say that life isn&#8217;t fair. Doesn&#8217;t the Bible say something about children suffering for the sins of their fathers? I&#8217;ve definitely experienced that. But you&#8217;ve gotta give it your best, no matter what that best looks like.</p>
