Three years ago my mother passed away, and my family separated. My sister, her boyfriend, and two kids — and my struggle is making sure they have what they need. Once they’re on their feet, I’m gonna get my own apartment, get my life together, maybe go back to school. I want to do art. I want to paint. I want to draw.
