The core of creativity is authenticity. Honesty is freeing. People often feel the need to put on a show, even in business. You have to pretend like you know more than you know in order to get the job, but I feel like that’s unhealthy, but it’s often the state in which we find ourselves. So the question is: how do I deal with the way the world is currently versus what I think it ought to be, the ideology versus the pragmatism. And I tend to lean more toward ideology.

That’s why I’m talking to people and asking them to share their stories. I feel like there’s some truth in that, and it’s interesting to meet people and hear what their struggles are, and hear them put into words what they think is important in life.

Troy’s in such an interesting place right now. There’s a lot of change happening, a lot of good and a lot of bad. And I think listening to and sharing stories helps build empathy, taking time to consider how other people think and also to find comfort in knowing you’re probably not the only person who thinks like you do. There’s someone out there who thinks like me or I never thought of it from that perspective. Empathy building exercise.
